# Open ECG Digitizer

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2510.19590-00cc66.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19590) ![Tests](https://github.com/Ahus-AIM/Electrocardiogram-Digitization/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20style-google-3666d6.svg) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31211/)

This repository provides a highly configurable tool for digitizing 12-lead ECGs, extracting raw time series data from scanned images or photographs (e.g., taken with a phone). It supports any subset of the 12 standard leads and is robust to perspective distortions and image quality variations.

## Features

- Extracts raw time series data from 12-lead ECG images
- Supports both scanned and photographed ECGs (with perspective correction)
- Works with any subset of leads
- Easily configurable via yaml config files

## File structure and module overview

Each component of the ECG digitization pipeline is modularized under [`src/model`](src/model).

Below is an overview of their purpose and debugging relevance, in approximate execution order:

| Module | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| [`src/model/unet.py`](src/model/unet.py) | **Semantic segmentation network** - a U-Net model trained to identify ECG traces, grids, and background. Retrain or fine-tune it using [`src/train.py`](src/train.py) if it underperforms. You can modify the on-the-fly transforms to mimic your own data [`src/transform/vision.py`](src/transform/vision.py). |
| ([`src/model/dewarper.py`](src/model/dewarper.py)) | **Experimental full dewarping** - for folded or curved ECG paper. Not formally evaluated. Not recommended for flat papers, as perspective correction is more robust. Not enabled in the provided configuration YAML files. |
| [`src/model/perspective_detector.py`](src/model/perspective_detector.py) | **Perspective correction** - estimates and corrects projective distortions. Handles up to ~45° rotation. |
| [`src/model/cropper.py`](src/model/cropper.py) | **Cropping and bounding box extraction** - used to crop the image based on the location of the ECG leads. |
| [`src/model/pixel_size_finder.py`](src/model/pixel_size_finder.py) | **Grid size estimation** - autocorrelation-based template matching. Configure grid parameters (minor/major ratio, expected line counts) in your inference YAML in case this underperforms. |
| [`src/model/lead_identifier.py`](src/model/lead_identifier.py) | **Layout identification** - matches cropped regions to known ECG lead layouts using predefined templates. Update or prune templates in `src/config/lead_layouts_*.yml`. |
| [`src/model/signal_extractor.py`](src/model/signal_extractor.py) | **Segmentation-to-trace conversion** - converts segmented images into digitized voltage–time signals. Might set parts of signals to NaN in case of overlapping signals. |
| [`src/model/inference_wrapper.py`](src/model/inference_wrapper.py) | **Main orchestration script** - connects all components. |

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.12 or later.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 24.04.2 and Debian 12 with CUDA. You need to install git-lfs to download the weights.

1. Ensure you have installed python3.12, git and git-lfs.
2. Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:Ahus-AIM/Electrocardiogram-Digitization.git```
3. Navigate to the project_source_code folder.
4. Create and activate a virtual environment: ```python3.12 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate```
5. Install dependencies ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
6. Download the pre-trained weights: ```git lfs pull```

## Running inference on a folder with images
1. Modify a config file with your paths and settings, for example [src/config/inference_wrapper_ahus_testset.yml](src/config/inference_wrapper_ahus_testset.yml)
2. Ensure that your config file points to a layout file containing your expected layouts, for example [lead_layouts_reduced.yml](src/config/lead_layouts_reduced.yml) or [lead_layouts_george-moody-2024.yml](src/config/lead_layouts_george-moody-2024.yml)
3. Run: ```python3 -m src.digitize --config src/config/your_config_file.yml```
4. You can also override the config file, for example: ```python3 -m src.digitize --config src/config/your_config_file.yml DATA.output_path=my_output/folder```

> [!NOTE]
> The output values are expressed in **microvolts (µV)**.

## Training dataset
The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face:
[huggingface.co/datasets/Ahus-AIM/Open-ECG-Digitizer-Development-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ahus-AIM/Open-ECG-Digitizer-Development-Dataset)

### Dataset characteristics
- Multiple grid types, colors and sizes
- Perspective distortions, varying illumination, and noise
- Pixel-level annotations for ECG traces, grid, and background

The dataset is intended to support:
- Retraining or fine-tuning of the segmentation network
- Development of alternative ECG digitization approaches

## Train on custom dataset
1. Change `data_path` for TRAIN, VAL and TEST in [src/config/unet.yml](src/config/unet.yml) to the locations of the custom dataset.
2. Run: ```python3 -m src.train```
